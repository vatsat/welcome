# Welcome to VATsat
G'day and welcome to VATsat, For those curious as to what VATsat is let me give you a brief rundown.

First of all VATsat stands for Virtual Air Traffic Statistics and Tracking, Our aim is to make tracking statistics and aircraft over multiple FSD-Networks easily accomplishable in one place.

All going well within the upcoming weeks, once VATsat is stable enough for beta, we will open our doors to a closed beta which you will be able to apply for on our website.

At this stage VATsat plans on having an easy to use virtual radar along side with a nice and clean statistics centre, we also plan on developing a desktop application to further the ease of our service.
